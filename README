*OVERVIEW
This assignment implements an asynchronous work queue manager.

FILES added.
1. hw3/sys_submitjob.c
2. hw3/sys_submitjob.h
3. hw3/work_item.h
4. hw3/user_net.c
5. hw3/xcrypt.c
6. hw3/test_script.sh
7. hw3/xhw3.c

Description of added files.
1.	Contains the implementation for the work queues.
2.	System Call Related Header.
3.	This file contains the structure declaration for work_item_node, job_types,
	job_priority.
4.	The Netlink socket creation and callback functions.
5.	The code for encryption/decryption.
6.	Running the test cases.
7.	The user code which submits the jobs to the system call.

USAGE:
Mandatory args:
-p ARG,		to provide the encryption/decryption key, (ARG) is the key
-e/-d,		to encrpyt/decrypt
infile,		the name of an input file to encrypt or decrypt
outfile,	the output file
-j ARG,		The job types:
		  	1: XCRYPT
		   	2: COMPRESSION
		   	3: CONCATENATE_FILES
		   	4: LIST_QUEUED_JOBS
		   	5: CHANGE_JOB_PRIORITY
		   	6: REMOVE_JOB
-k ARG,		The priority of the job: Possible Values:
	   		1: HIGH
	   		2: MEDIUM
	   		3: LOW
	   		In case user wants to change job priority
	   		this should hold the new job priority
-c ARG,		The cipher name to be used
-z ARG,		The job id to delete when job type is
	   		REMOVE_JOB and job priority to change to
	   		when job type is CHANGE_JOB_PRIORITY

Usage Example - 
1. To display help message
./xhw3.c -h

2. Encrypting the input file
./xhw3 -j 1 -k 1 -e -p <password> <infile> <outfile>

3. Decrypting the input file
./xhw3 -j 1 -k 1 -d -p <password> <infile> <outfile>

4. List the jobs in the work_item queue.
./xhw3 -j 4

5. Changing priority of a job
./xhw3 -j 5 -z <job_id> -k <new_priority>

6. To remove an exisiting job from the work_item queue.
./xhw3 -j 6 -z <job_id>

For Detailed Design on the implementation please refer to the design.pdf file.
